# Palindrome Checker App – UC7 (Deque-Based Optimized Palindrome Checker)

## Objective
The objective of this application is to check whether a given string is a palindrome using a Deque data structure while strengthening core programming and data structure concepts.

## Use Case
UC7: Deque-Based Optimized Palindrome Checker

## Goal
Use Deque to compare front and rear elements for palindrome validation.

## Algorithm / Flow
1. Read the input string from the user
2. Convert the string to lowercase and remove spaces
3. Insert each character into the deque
4. Remove characters from the front and rear
5. Compare both characters
6. If all characters match, it is a palindrome
7. If any mismatch occurs, it is not a palindrome

## Key Concepts Used
- Deque (Double Ended Queue)
- Front and Rear Operations
- String Processing
- Efficient Comparison Technique
- Optimized Palindrome Checking

## Data Structure Used
Deque (ArrayDeque)
